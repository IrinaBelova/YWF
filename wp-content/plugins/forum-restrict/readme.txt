== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why was this plugin created? =

To facilitate restricting access to forums on a user-by-user and forum-by-forum basis, creating a site where different sets of users can have access to different forums.

= How do I use it? =

I use it to create support groups for people who struggle with various mental health issues and separate forums on the same site for other users who are spouses or famiy members of the individuals in the first group. They should not be able to read each other's posts.
